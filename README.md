I've embarked on an exciting coding challenge with Arsh, aiming to solve 280 questions in just 45 days. This ambitious endeavor is not only a test of our coding skills but also a journey of discipline, perseverance, and continuous learning. Each day brings new problems to tackle, pushing us to think critically and creatively. With a structured plan and mutual support, we're determined to enhance our problem-solving abilities and achieve this goal together. The challenge is rigorous, but the rewards of improved proficiency and the satisfaction of accomplishment are well worth the effort.
